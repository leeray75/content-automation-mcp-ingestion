# Issue #5 Phase 5: Testing

## Overview
Implement comprehensive testing of the updated implementation to ensure all functionality works correctly without SSE transport and that the new authentication scaffold is properly integrated.

## Objectives
- [ ] Test HTTP streaming transport functionality
- [ ] Verify MCP Inspector connectivity
- [ ] Test authentication middleware scaffold
- [ ] Validate all API endpoints
- [ ] Ensure Docker deployment works correctly

## Tasks

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Update existing unit tests to remove SSE references
- [ ] Add tests for new authentication middleware
- [ ] Test transport manager with HTTP-only configuration
- [ ] Test event queue functionality (if retained)
- [ ] Verify configuration validation

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test MCP Inspector connection via HTTP
- [ ] Test all MCP tools and resources
- [ ] Test direct API endpoints (`/health`, `/ingest`, `/records`)
- [ ] Test authentication middleware with different configurations
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases

### Docker Testing
- [ ] Build Docker image successfully
- [ ] Test container startup with HTTP transport
- [ ] Verify health checks work correctly
- [ ] Test MCP Inspector connection to Docker container
- [ ] Test environment variable configuration

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Benchmark HTTP streaming performance
- [ ] Test concurrent MCP connections
- [ ] Verify memory usage without SSE overhead
- [ ] Test authentication middleware performance impact
- [ ] Monitor resource utilization

### Manual Testing Scenarios
- [ ] Fresh installation and setup
- [ ] MCP Inspector workflow (dev, HTTP, Docker modes)
- [ ] Content ingestion via MCP tools
- [ ] Content ingestion via direct API
- [ ] Authentication enabled/disabled scenarios

## Test Files to Update/Create
- `test/ingestion.test.ts` (update existing)
- `test/transport.test.ts` (create new)
- `test/auth.test.ts` (create new)
- `test/integration.test.ts` (create new)

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Docker testing
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:run:http
npm run docker:inspect
```

## Verification Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Server starts successfully in HTTP mode
- [ ] All MCP tools respond correctly
- [ ] All MCP resources accessible
- [ ] Health endpoint returns correct status
- [ ] Direct ingestion endpoint works

### MCP Inspector Integration
- [ ] Inspector connects via HTTP transport
- [ ] All tools visible and functional in Inspector
- [ ] All resources accessible in Inspector
- [ ] Tool invocation works correctly
- [ ] Resource fetching works correctly

### Authentication Testing
- [ ] Server works with auth disabled (default)
- [ ] Server works with auth enabled
- [ ] Invalid tokens rejected correctly
- [ ] Valid tokens accepted correctly
- [ ] Auth configuration reflected in metadata

### Docker Deployment
- [ ] Docker image builds without errors
- [ ] Container starts and runs correctly
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Inspector can connect to container
- [ ] All functionality works in container

## Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] HTTP streaming latency < 100ms
- [ ] Memory usage < 50MB baseline
- [ ] CPU usage < 5% idle
- [ ] Concurrent connections > 10
- [ ] Authentication overhead < 10ms

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] MCP Inspector fully functional
- [ ] Docker deployment successful
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] No SSE-related errors or warnings
- [ ] Authentication scaffold works correctly

## Estimated Time
3-4 hours

## Test Documentation
- [ ] Update test README with new procedures
- [ ] Document authentication testing scenarios
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Document performance benchmarks

## Next Phase
Phase 6 will perform final validation and create comprehensive completion documentation.
