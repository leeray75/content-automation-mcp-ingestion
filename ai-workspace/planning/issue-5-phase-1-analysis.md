# Issue #5 Phase 1: Analysis

## Overview
Analyze the current codebase to identify all SSE references and understand the current transport implementation. This phase provides the foundation for subsequent removal phases.

## Objectives
- [ ] Inventory all files containing SSE references
- [ ] Confirm current MCP SDK version and HTTP streaming capabilities
- [ ] Document current transport architecture
- [ ] Identify test files that need updates

## Tasks

### Code Analysis
- [ ] Search for all occurrences of `SSEServerTransport` in codebase
- [ ] Search for all occurrences of `/sse` endpoint references
- [ ] Search for "Server-Sent Events" in documentation
- [ ] Review `src/server/transport.ts` implementation details
- [ ] Check `package.json` for MCP SDK version compatibility

### Documentation Review
- [ ] Audit `README.md` for SSE references
- [ ] Review ai-workspace documentation files
- [ ] Check Docker configuration and health checks
- [ ] Review scripts for SSE-specific references

### Test Analysis
- [ ] Identify unit tests referencing SSE endpoints
- [ ] Check integration tests for SSE dependencies
- [ ] Review test configuration files

## Deliverables
- Complete inventory of files requiring changes
- Current architecture documentation
- List of tests needing updates
- Compatibility assessment for MCP SDK HTTP streaming

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All SSE references catalogued with file paths and line numbers
- [ ] Current transport implementation fully understood
- [ ] Test impact assessment completed
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing HTTP streaming functionality

## Estimated Time
1-2 hours

## Files to Analyze
- `src/server/transport.ts`
- `package.json`
- `README.md`
- `scripts/docker-inspect.sh`
- `scripts/inspector.sh`
- `test/ingestion.test.ts`
- All files in `ai-workspace/` directory

## Next Phase
Phase 2 will implement the core SSE removal based on findings from this analysis.
