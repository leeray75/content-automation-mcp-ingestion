# Technical Issues Documentation

## Purpose
This folder contains detailed documentation of technical issues, bugs, and maintenance tasks discovered during development. Each issue is documented with sufficient detail for future AI coding assistants or developers to understand, reproduce, and fix the problems.

## Folder Structure
```
technical-issues/
├── README.md                           # This file - explains the folder purpose
├── test-syntax-error-vitest-chai.md    # Vitest assertion syntax error in test suite
└── [future-issue-files].md             # Additional issues as they are discovered
```

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Include the issue type and brief description
- Format: `{type}-{brief-description}.md`
- Examples:
  - `test-syntax-error-vitest-chai.md`
  - `build-typescript-compilation-error.md`
  - `security-dependency-vulnerability.md`

### Required Sections
Each technical issue document should include:

1. **Issue Summary** - Status, priority, type, discovery date
2. **Error Description** - Detailed error messages and context
3. **Root Cause Analysis** - Technical explanation of the problem
4. **Correct Solutions** - Multiple solution options with pros/cons
5. **Recommended Fix** - Best practice solution with rationale
6. **Implementation Steps** - Step-by-step fix instructions
7. **Impact Assessment** - Current and post-fix impact analysis
8. **Prevention** - How to avoid similar issues in the future
9. **Notes for AI Coding Assistants** - Context and guidance for automated fixes

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Blocks development or causes production issues
- **High**: Affects core functionality or developer productivity
- **Medium**: Impacts non-critical features or causes minor inconvenience
- **Low**: Technical debt, code quality, or test maintenance issues

### Status Values
- **Open**: Issue needs to be addressed
- **In Progress**: Someone is actively working on the fix
- **Fixed**: Issue has been resolved and verified
- **Closed**: Issue resolved or determined to be non-issue

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Coding Assistants
1. **Review existing issues** before starting work to understand known problems
2. **Check issue status** to avoid duplicate work
3. **Follow implementation steps** exactly as documented
4. **Update status** when beginning work (Open → In Progress)
5. **Document resolution** when fix is complete (In Progress → Fixed)
6. **Test thoroughly** using provided verification steps

### For Human Developers
1. **Create new issue docs** when discovering technical problems
2. **Update existing docs** if additional context or solutions are found
3. **Reference issue docs** in commit messages and pull requests
4. **Archive or remove** docs for issues that are permanently resolved

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Discovery Phase
- Issues discovered during development should be documented immediately
- Include context about when/how the issue was found
- Note any workarounds or temporary solutions applied

### Resolution Phase
- Update issue status when work begins
- Document any deviations from the recommended fix
- Include test results and verification steps performed

### Post-Resolution
- Update status to "Fixed" with resolution date
- Consider if the issue doc should remain for reference or be archived
- Update related documentation (README, troubleshooting guides, etc.)

## Current Issues

### Open Issues
1. **test-syntax-error-vitest-chai.md** - Vitest assertion syntax error (Priority: Low)

### Recently Fixed
- None yet

### Archived
- None yet
