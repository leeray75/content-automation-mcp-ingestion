Read ai-workspace/planning/issue-9/phase-3-mcp-protocol-compliance.md. Then read any files in ai-workspace/completion-reports/issue-9/. Produce a short verification checklist and minimal test steps to confirm MCP tool/resource compliance (what to run and success criteria). After you have implemented the Phase 3 plan and all verification steps pass, create a short completion report at ai-workspace/completion-reports/issue-9/issue-9-phase-3-completion-report.md summarizing the work performed, verification results, and any remaining items. Do not create the report until implementation and tests are complete. After creating the completion report, commit all changes with an appropriate commit message.
