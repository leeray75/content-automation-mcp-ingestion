Read ai-workspace/planning/issue-9/phase-2-transport-reconciliation.md. Then read any files in ai-workspace/completion-reports/issue-9/. Produce a compact implementation checklist, exact source files to inspect, and risks/unknowns to resolve before work begins. Create a short completion report at ai-workspace/completion-reports/issue-9/issue-9-phase-2-completion-report.md summarizing work done and remaining items.
