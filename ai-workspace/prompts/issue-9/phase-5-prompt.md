Read ai-workspace/planning/issue-9/phase-5-testing-documentation.md. Then read any files in ai-workspace/completion-reports/issue-9/. Produce a concise testing & documentation checklist with critical acceptance tests and documentation files to update. After all testing and documentation updates described in the Phase 5 plan are implemented and acceptance tests pass, create a short completion report at ai-workspace/completion-reports/issue-9/issue-9-phase-5-completion-report.md summarizing test results, documentation changes, and release/close criteria. Do not create the report until implementation and tests are complete.
