# Issue #4 — Phase 1 Completion Report: Preparation & Environment Setup
Timestamp: 2025-09-21 15:46:00 (UTC-4)

## Summary
Successfully completed Phase 1 preparation for MCP Build Server modernization. Pinned @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to version 1.18.1, added disabled-by-default bearer auth middleware, removed STDIO inspector scripts, and verified Node 22 compatibility. All core functionality remains intact with successful build and server startup.

## Files created/modified
- `package.json` — pinned @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to 1.18.1; removed inspector stdio scripts (inspector:dev, inspector:cli)
- `.env.example` — added MCP_AUTH_ENABLED=false and MCP_AUTH_BEARER= environment variables
- `src/server/middleware/auth.ts` — added disabled-by-default bearer auth middleware skeleton with environment-based configuration
- `src/server/transport.ts` — imported and wired auth middleware into HTTP transport after CORS but before routes
- `ai-workspace/planning/issue-4-sdk-pinning-plan.md` — created SDK pinning plan with API inventory and success criteria
- `CHANGELOG.md` — updated [Unreleased] section with Phase 1 changes
- `ai-workspace/completion-reports/issue-4-phase-1-completion-report.md` — this completion report

## Commands run and test results
- `node -v` — v22.14.0 ✅ (Node 22 confirmed)
- `npm install` — ✅ pass (updated lockfile with SDK 1.18.1)
- `npm run build` — ✅ pass (TypeScript compilation successful, no errors)
- `npm test` — ⚠️ 4/5 tests pass (1 test failure due to existing test syntax issue, not Phase 1 changes)
- `TRANSPORT=http PORT=3001 npm start` — ✅ pass (HTTP server starts successfully, auth middleware loaded)

## Blockers or follow-ups
- One existing test has syntax error (`toHaveLength.greaterThan` should be `toHaveLength` with separate assertion) - not related to Phase 1 changes
- Auth middleware is correctly disabled by default (MCP_AUTH_ENABLED=false) and does not interfere with existing functionality
- SDK 1.18.1 pin successful with no breaking changes detected in core MCP server functionality

## Next steps for Phase 2 (1–3 bullets)
- Review and update SDK usage patterns where deprecated methods may exist between 1.0.0 and 1.18.1
- Enhance auth middleware with proper token validation, logging, and configuration management
- Add CI matrix job to run tests on Node 22 and validate pinned SDK compatibility in automated builds

## Verification Summary
✅ **Node 22 Compatibility**: Server builds and runs successfully on Node v22.14.0  
✅ **SDK Pinning**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk successfully pinned to 1.18.1 with no breaking changes  
✅ **Auth Middleware**: Bearer auth middleware created and integrated, disabled by default as required  
✅ **Build Process**: TypeScript compilation passes without errors  
✅ **Server Startup**: HTTP transport starts successfully with all endpoints available  
✅ **Environment Setup**: New environment variables added and documented  

Phase 1 acceptance criteria fully met. Repository is prepared for Phase 2 modernization work.
