# Issue #2 Sync Completion Report: Submodule Pino-Pretty Fix

## Summary
Successfully synchronized the pino-pretty dependency fix from the content-automation-stack submodule to the content-automation-mcp-ingestion superproject. This ensures the fix is available in the standalone repository and maintains consistency across the project ecosystem.

## Implementation Details

### Root Cause
The content-automation-mcp-ingestion service was experiencing crashes due to a missing `pino-pretty` dependency. The fix was originally applied in the submodule within the content-automation-stack project, but needed to be propagated to the standalone superproject repository.

### Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added `"pino-pretty": "^11.2.2"` to production dependencies
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree and resolved package versions
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added entry in [Unreleased] section documenting the fix

### Key Changes Implemented
1. **Dependency Addition**: Added `pino-pretty ^11.2.2` to the dependencies section of package.json
2. **Lock File Update**: Ran `npm install` to update package-lock.json with the complete dependency tree
3. **Documentation Update**: Updated CHANGELOG.md to document the fix with proper issue reference
4. **Branch Creation**: Created `feature/sync-submodule-issue-2` branch for the changes

### Technical Decisions
- **Dependency Placement**: Added to production dependencies (not devDependencies) to match the submodule implementation
- **Version Consistency**: Used the same version `^11.2.2` as applied in the submodule for consistency
- **Branch Strategy**: Created a feature branch to allow for proper review and integration workflow
